#RSS Menu Extension for Safari
##(c) 2012-16 Calum Benson

###What Does It Do?

* Adds a menu button to your Safari toolbar that lists autodiscovered feeds (per the [RSS Autodiscovery Spec](http://www.rssboard.org/rss-autodiscovery))
* ~~Also lists public playlist, subscription and favourites feeds when browsing a YouTube user or channel homepage.~~ Obsoleted by YouTube API changes
* Opens feeds either in your native news reader app (Vienna, Reeder, NetNewsWire etc.), or directly in Safari.
* Toolbar button badge shows how many feeds available on current page.
 

###Planned features

* Subscribe to feeds in Google Reader replacements like Feedly and Digg.

###Notes

* Works with Safari v6 or later. 
* "Open in Application" feature requires that your application is registered with OS X as the default handler for `feed://` URIs. Most of the popular apps do this, but some (e.g. [RSSOwl](http://www.rssowl.org)) do not.
