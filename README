RSS Menu Extension for Safari
(c) 2012-13 Calum Benson

What Does It Do?

* Adds a menu button to your Safari toolbar that lists autodiscovered feeds (see http://www.rssboard.org/rss-autodiscovery)
* Opens feeds either in your native news reader app (Vienna, Reeder, NetNewsWire etc.), or directly in Safari.
* Toolbar button badge shows how many feeds available on current page.

Works with Safari v6 or later.
